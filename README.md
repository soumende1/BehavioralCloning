# Project Description - BehavioralCloning
This is the code for third project (Behavioral Cloning)

This project makes use of a Udacity-developed driving simulator and training data collected from the simulator. The training data need to be developed by running the car in the simulator in training mode. The training data is generated by  images captured from the different camera  in the simulator car (i.e camera mounted in the the centre, the left and the right of the car).
Three images and the steering angle will be generated per frame and a sample data set is show below

- Left- left_2018_07_31_22_27_43_693.jpg
- Right- right_2018_07_31_22_27_43_693.jpg
- Steering angle- -0.5494633

One the **training data** is generated for one lap of driving for the chosen test track, a deep neural network is used to clone car driving behaviour. It is a **supervised regression** problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.
The network is based on The NVIDIA model, which has been proven to work in this problem domain.
As image processing is involved, the model is using convolutional layers for automated feature engineering.
